### Running the project


Currently, just downloading the project won't run it. You must have
a version of Godot 4 downloaded. Link: https://godotengine.org/

To run it, you simply download the source code, use import to find
the main folder and put that into Godot, and hit the small play
button in the top right. 

Unfortunately, there is no sort of menu implemented yet, so you
must close the window to end the program.
